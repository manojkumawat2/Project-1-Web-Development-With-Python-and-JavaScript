### Project Details

It is my first project of web development under cs50 course web development with python and javascript. In this project, I have used flask as the backend and Bootstrap framework for front end development.

It is a simple Book Review website. Here users can register and search for book and then check the average rating of the book. User can also check the <b>[GoodReads](http://goodreads.com/)</b> rating that book.

I have used the api of <b>[GoodReads](http://goodreads.com/)</b> website so that user can check the check the rating of the book easily.

User can also give the rating to the books and comment.
